&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote above really hit me, in the sense that I’ve always been critical of my own sense of self-discipline. ‘How do I attain this unbreakable willpower and monk-level discipline to stay focused and achieve my goals?’ was a common self criticism that rang around in my head. The more I get a chance to break down how habits are structured and the triggers/cues that engage them work, I realise that everyone probably struggles with these kinds of thoughts to a certain degree. Finding a strategy that works for you is something probably almost everyone needs to do at some point in order to be more successful. My personal journey has been fraught with self deprecation towards this particular subject and I find it enlightening and relieving to encounter the topic discussed in this way. I have already started to bundle certain habits (coffee-morning wins), but am going to try and think of a way to help myself get focused when I start work. Integrating this phase of the day into a habit would greatly increase my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-secret-to-self-control&quot;&gt;The Secret to Self Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evidenced and reinforced by research done on military heroin addicts, environment is a huge factor in determining the strength of a habit, even if it’s chemical. While culture often dictates a lack of discipline to come from an absence of willpower, evidence suggests that the people with the best self-control are in fact those who have to use it the least. Being smart with the way you position yourself within a context can have drastic impacts on how well you are able to make or break habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists refer to the self-feeding nature of bad habits with the term &lt;strong&gt;cue-induced wanting&lt;/strong&gt;. This essentially entails that an external trigger(&lt;strong&gt;cue&lt;/strong&gt;) causes a subconscious compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s possible to break bad habits, these cues are soo deeply ingrained that they are nigh impossible to remove. Finding yourself in the same environment years later, you might suddenly feel that pang to engage. Since maintaining iron willpower is nearly impossible in the long term, it is a far better strategy to manipulate your environment (as discussed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45/&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; section). &lt;em&gt;Minimise access to the cue!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, referring to the first law of habit forming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Good Habit&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bad Habit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the cue obvious&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the cue invisible&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-make-a-habit-irresistible&quot;&gt;How to Make a Habit Irresistible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second law&lt;/strong&gt;: Make it attractive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly to how animals are ‘preloaded’ with certain behaviours (as demonstrated by Tinbergen’s bird-with-red-dotted-beak research), humans also react to certain stimulus subconsciously. These cues are known as &lt;em&gt;supernormal stimuli&lt;/em&gt;. Hunting for thousands of years has conditioned people to react a certain way to food high in salt, fat, and sugar–this means that even now, we go into something of a frenzy at the sight of a Big Mac. The modern food industry is just one of many that market products to appeal to this natural sense of craving, and further enhance it by making products more attractive in all sorts of ways(texture, colour, odour, etc)–they enhance the cue by &lt;em&gt;making it attractive&lt;/em&gt;, encouraging patrons to repeat the habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-craving&quot;&gt;What is craving?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how to make a habit more attractive, or even triggered by a supernormal stimulus, we must understand craving, and the role of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is intrinsically interlinked with habits. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop–the dopamine is what keeps you coming back. Rats who had their dopamine receptors blocked in experiments soon lost all interest in food, sex, and basically their will to live on the whole. While we often think of the dopamine release to be associated with engaging in the activity itself, it is important to note that dopamine is released also in &lt;strong&gt;anticipation&lt;/strong&gt; of the activity. &lt;em&gt;The reward system in your brain that is activated when you receieve the reward, is the same system that is activated when you anticipate the reward!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;middle&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bll8cAJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dopamine spike patterns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: gray; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Dopamine spike patterns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above you see how dopamine spikes manifest depending on the stage of habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The next time, dopamine is released in &lt;em&gt;anticipation&lt;/em&gt;. Since the reward is expected, dopamine spike is minimal&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If you don’t receive the reward, you have a negative dopamine spike, because your expectations were subverted.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reward is provided, but later than expected.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These diagrams have a very important takeaway: &lt;strong&gt;desire is the engine that drives behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;. After the reward is known and expected, the dopamine largely comes in anticipation of the reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;temptation-bundling&quot;&gt;Temptation bundling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method of making habits more attractive relies on bundling an action that you want to do, with an action that you need to do. Without going into great detail, the idea behind this is that you’re more likely to find an initially unattractive behaviour attractive if you pair it with one of your favourite things to do. An classic example of this is watching a movie/series while running on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy can be further combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45/&quot;&gt;habit stacking&lt;/a&gt;, such that you can chain habits while tentation bundling for maximum effect, in the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After [current habit], I will [habit I need]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After [habit I need], I will [habit I want]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temptation bundling is an excellent strategy to decrease the resistance towards a habit, by basically “softening the blow”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional note: The author made reference to Dutch Nobel prize-winning scientist Nikolaas Tinbergen, and I caught the last name as familiar; the only Dutch economist to ever win the Nobel prize was also named Tinbergen. As it turns out, they were brothers! Apparently, they also had a third brother, who didn’t win any Nobels–I wonder what the dinner table was like there at christmas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>anonymous</name><email>habitsblog1@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Atomic Habits" /><summary type="html">“The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Manipulating Cues and Environments - Atomic Habits 4-5</title><link href="https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Manipulating Cues and Environments - Atomic Habits 4-5" /><published>2019-05-16T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-05-16T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/16/atomic45/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These chapters were all about habit building strategies centered around the first tenet of Clear’s doctrine, manipulating &lt;em&gt;cues&lt;/em&gt;. I was particularly intrigued by the habit-stacking strategy, in which one can essentially create a complete chain of behaviours. In previous meetings we had discussed what I see defined here as implementation intentions, something I think I would do well to try to apply–some of the positive habits that I have started to build rely on pure excitement and willpowere to maintain, and could use a bit more structure. I think about running for example, something that I like to do at the end of a long day, but happens spontaneously before or after dinner, and not exactly at a set time or on a specific day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section on environment was interesting to read within the context of habits, as I had seen it before somewhat in behavioural economics texts describing “nudge” theory. One of the described notions that I had discovered on my own in past years was to separate your workspace from your personal space, something that is occasionally hard to do as a student living in one room. I do however notice how significantly different my mind operates in one environment or another. The cues surrounding me right now for example, are centered largely around leisure and relaxation–there is a guitar, there is a computer, a comfy sofa, and a little electronics project on the table–everything points towards downtime. While most of these objects serve one purpose, the computer for example is somewhat neutral. Once it has been designated for a certain role/habit however, it is hard to recontextualise. I know of myself that I am very sensitive to these environmental &lt;em&gt;cues&lt;/em&gt;, and that it is important for me to try and surround myself with environments that stimulate building of productive habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-habit-building-strategies&quot;&gt;Two Habit Building Strategies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation Intentions&lt;/em&gt; - A statement expressing how and when you intend to implement a specific habit (proven to increase your likelihood to perform said action)
People who make a plan, will follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will [behaviour] at [time] in [location].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Habit Stacking&lt;/em&gt; - No behaviour happens in isolation (Diderot effect - lifestyle upgrades). One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit, and stack your behaviour on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After [current habit], I will  [new habit]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining habits, pairing them, bonding them, will make you more likely to assimilate the new one. The key is to use a habit that you already have deeply ingrained as the first link in the chain–eventually, as a master you will be able to create multi-habit combo stacks. Within the previous framework, the existing habit acts as the &lt;em&gt;cue&lt;/em&gt; for the new habit.
For optimal effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cue should have the same frequency as the desired habit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cue should be highly specific, and immediately actionable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;em&gt;implementation intentions&lt;/em&gt; to make cues clearer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;environment-vs-motivation&quot;&gt;Environment vs Motivation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is really interesting–a lot of “nudge” theory as to how your direct environment supports the development of new/breaking of old habits. (Recall the example about placement of healthy foods in school cafeterias from Thaler.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human beings perceive mostly the world empirically, through the use of our five senses–however, of the 11 million sensory receptors we possess, 10 million are dedicated to sight. “A small change in what you &lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt; can lead to a big change in what you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall: Every habit is initiated by a cue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are more likely to notice cues that stand out, we can initiate these habits more successfully by placing cues more accessibly. Sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings helps you notice and think about your habit more often, and thus increases your chance of actuating the habit successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting point–besides your own home (and even then) most of the world around us is structured by others, and often done to make you engage with your environment in a certain way. Changing your environment, this form of intrusion, is powerful because it isn’t something that people tend to do very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-context&quot;&gt;On Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about triggers and surroundings previously, but it is important to realise that cues are contextual. Triggers are seldom individual cues, but rather the product of a surrounding with various sensory inputs–a context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider not what an object is, but what your relationship the object is. What does the object represent to you? The couch is where you like to read, the mirror is where you brush your teeth, but to someone else, these objects might represent something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategically important&lt;/strong&gt;: Building a new habit can be much easier in a new environment, one in which the context is as yet undefined to you. A blank canvas is easier to start painting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever possible avoid mixing the context of one habit with another! When you are mixing contexts, you are bound to try to mix habits, and the easier habit will win out. I know this from personal experience, unfortunately..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. The same goes for working, sleeping, or any other manner of activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>anonymous</name><email>habitsblog1@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Atomic Habits" /><summary type="html">Personal Context</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hacking the habit process - Atomic Habits 3-4</title><link href="https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/13/atomic34/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hacking the habit process - Atomic Habits 3-4" /><published>2019-05-13T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-05-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/13/atomic34</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://habitsblog.github.io/2019/05/13/atomic34/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, your mind will strive to “pawn off” tasks to the unconscious brain. Since a habit is essentially just a behaviour that becomes automated, it is desirable to form good habits–so that you can have as many as possible life-improving and identity changing behaviours behave automatically. This in place of laying the task on your conscious brain, which takes significantly more effort. This provides you with more conscious freedom to expend wherever you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-process-of-building-a-habit&quot;&gt;The process of building a habit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The habit building process as described by Clear can be divided in to four steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cue - Trigger your brain to initiate a behaviour. Basically, any kind of sensory input, activity, or something that can trigger a behavioural response. The cue is about &lt;strong&gt;noticing&lt;/strong&gt; the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Craving - The motivational force behind every habit, the “&lt;strong&gt;why?&lt;/strong&gt;”. The craving is about &lt;strong&gt;wanting&lt;/strong&gt; the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Response - The actual habit you form, the action that you perform in response to the cue. Objective of the response, is to achieve the reward. The response is about &lt;strong&gt;obtaining&lt;/strong&gt; the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward - Finally, the reward that is delivered by the response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process constitutes a subconscious neurological feedback loop that you go through every time you perform a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hacking-the-habit-process&quot;&gt;Hacking the habit process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having introduced this process, Clear’s theory starts to come into play–his goal for the next sections is to try to elucidate how one might positively influence this process according to his methodology, in order to build &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; habits and break &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He mentions briefly the ways he views this, for each step of the habit forming process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Step&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Forming a good habit&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Breaking a bad habit&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Cue&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the cue obvious&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the cue invisible&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Craving&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the craving attractive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the craving unattractive&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Response&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the response Easy&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the response difficult&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Reward&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the reward satisfying&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make the reward Unsatisfying&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These objectives are referred to by Clear as &lt;strong&gt;The Four Laws for Behaviour Change&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-first-law-make-it-obvious&quot;&gt;The first law: Make it obvious&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the habits that we have already ingrained, run automatically as described in the previous section. Clear refers to the “point and call” practice applied by Japanese train conductors–by explicitly calling out every step of the conductor’s safety protocol, they have significantly reduced human error. This same ideal applied to habit forming starts with the explicit identification of habits, be they good or bad. His suggested method for doing this is the habit scorecard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, this method can provide you with a bit of a cursory overview as to daily habits and how you percieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I noticed that I scored relatively few daily habits negative (-), but feel that the scorecard lacks a weighting system that effectively emphasises the effect of each habit–my negative habits often steal a lot of time and energy out of my day. While “browse the internet again” doesn’t seem very harmful, it sucks if that happens to take up a whole hour or more, without any sense of real satisfaction besides temporary relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits Scorecard &amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;
Neutral (=)
Positive (+)
Negative (-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Habit&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Wake up&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Check Phone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Shower and get dressed&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Podcast on (positive or negative, depending on entertainment or educational)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make coffee&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;=&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Make (healthy) breakfast&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Wins for the day&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;+&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Browse news &amp;amp; reddit&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Brush teeth + Grooming&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
